## Intro to Web3

* Internet was invented in 1970s as a decentralized network of computers from across the United States (to provide greater security and keep the systems going in case of a Soviet attack)
* In 1989 Tim Berners Lee was developing the technology which would become the World Wide Web
* **Web 1.0** is defined as the version of the web that existed between 1990 to 2004. During this time, the internet mainly consisted of static websites owned by individual companies. This websites had very low user interaction possibilities, which is why Web 1.0 is commonly referred as *read-only* web
* Around 2005 internet speed increased significantly which allowed greater adoption and greater user interaction. This meant there were possibilities for using the internet. Because of this **Web 2.0** is also known as  the *read-write web*.
* Web 2.0 was also knows as centralized web, because the content is stored on a cloud storage management service like CloudFlare or AWS. Majority of the web is tied (centralized) to a small number of big organizations. If there are only issues with one of the large storage providers, a huge amount of active websites can be affected.
* In **Web 3.0** decentralization has returned. Data is encrypted and securely stored across multiple nodes (computers connected to a blockchain network). These nodes are run by individuals worldwide who are sharing their disk space for a fee. Because data is stored on multiple nodes instead of one central server like AWS, it is decentralized. This enhances data security for websites and their users.
* In Web 2.0 if you want to join a member community of a website you usually have to create a new user account for each website, in Web 3.0 you simply connect with your crypto wallet.
* Because of decentralization it is less likely that some service will stop working, because all of the servers would stop working suddenly. Decentralized network of nodes connected to the blockchain provides greater redundancy.
